Description: Provides some utilities for 3D meshes: clipping of a mesh to
    the volume bounded by another mesh, decomposition into convex parts,
    distance between a mesh and a point, volume, area, and centroid. All
    algorithms are performed by the 'C++' library 'CGAL'
    (<https://www.cgal.org/>).
